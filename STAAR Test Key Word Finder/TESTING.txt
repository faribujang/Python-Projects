Sundays too my father got up early 
and put his clothes on in the blueblack cold, 
then with cracked hands that ached 
from labor in the weekday weather made
 5 banked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him. 
I’d wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.; 
When the rooms were warm, he’d call,; 

and slowly I would rise and dress,; 
fearing the chronic angers of that house.; 10/ Speaking indifferently to him, who had driven out the cold 

and polished my good shoes as well. 

What did I know, what did I know 

of love’s austere and lonely offices?

Page 2. STAAR English II Reading 2011 ReleaseReading Selection 2 All My Babies. Are Gone Now. from Loud and Clear by Anna Quindlen1 All my babies are gone now. I say this not in sorrow but in disbelief. I take 
great satisfaction in what I have today: three almost-adults, two taller than 

me, one closing in fast. Three people who read the same books I do and 
have learned not to be afraid of disagreeing with me in their opinion of 

them, who sometimes tell vulgar jokes that make me laugh until I choke and 

cry, who need razor blades and shower gel and privacy, who want to keep 

their doors closed more than I like. Who, miraculously, go to the bathroom, 

zip up their jackets, and move food from plate to mouth all by themselves. 

Like the trick soap I bought for the bathroom with a rubber ducky at its 

center, the baby is buried deep within each, barely discernible except 

through the unreliable haze of the past.
2 Everything in all the books I once pored over is finished for me now. 

Penelope Leach, T. Berry Brazelton, Dr. Spock. The ones on sibling rivalry 

and sleeping through the night and early childhood education, all grown 
obsolete. Along with Goodnight Moon and Where the Wild Things Are, they 
are battered, spotted, well used. But I suspect that if you flipped the pages, 

dust would rise like memories.
3 What those books taught me, finally, and what the women on the 

playground taught me, and the well-meaning relations and the older parents 

at cocktail parties—what they taught me was that they couldn’t really teach 

me very much at all. Raising children is presented at first as a true-false 

test, then becomes multiple choice, until finally, far along, you realize that it 

is an endless essay. No one knows anything. One child responds well to 

positive reinforcement, another can only be managed with a stern voice and 

a time-out. One boy is toilet trained at three, his brother at two. When my 

first child was born, parents were told to put baby to bed on his belly so that 

he would not choke on his own spit-up. By the time my last arrived, babies 

were put down on their backs because of research on sudden infant death 
syndrome.4 As a new parent this ever-shifting certainty is terrifying, and then soothing. 

Eventually you must learn to trust yourself. Eventually the research will 

follow. . . .
5 I remember fifteen years ago poring over one of Dr. Brazelton’s wonderful 

books on child development, in which he describes three different sorts of 

infants: average, quiet, and active. I was looking for a sub-quiet codicil (see: 

slug) for an eighteen-month-old who did not walk. Was there something 
Page 3. STAAR English II Reading 2011 ReleaseReading Selection 2 wrong with his fat little legs? Was there something wrong with his tiny little 
mind? Was he developmentally delayed, physically challenged? Was I 

insane? Last year he went to China. Next year he goes to college. He can 
walk just fine. He can walk too well. Every part of raising children at some 
point comes down to this: Be careful what you wish for.
 6/ Every part of raising children is humbling, too. Believe me, mistakes were 

made. They have all been enshrined in the “Remember When Mom Did” Hall 

of Fame. The outbursts, the temper tantrums, the bad language—mine, not 

theirs. The times the baby fell off the bed. The times I arrived late for 

preschool pickup. The nightmare sleepover. The horrible summer camp. The 

day when the youngest came barreling out of the classroom with a 98 on her 

geography test, and I responded, “What did you get wrong?” (She insisted I 
include that.) The time I ordered food at the McDonald’s drive-through 

speaker and then drove away without picking it up from the window. (They 

all insisted I include that.) I did not allow them to watch 
The Simpsons for the first two seasons. What was I thinking?
 7/ But the biggest mistake I made is the one that most of us make while doing 

this. I did not live in the moment enough. This is particularly clear now that 

the moment is gone, captured only in photographs. There is one picture of 

the three of them sitting in the grass on a quilt in the shadow of the swing 

set on a summer day, ages six, four, and one. And I wish I could remember 

what we ate, and what we talked about, and how they sounded, and how 

they looked when they slept that night. I wish I had not been in such a hurry 

to get on to the next thing: dinner, bath, book, bed. I wish I had treasured 

the doing a little more and the getting it done a little less. 8/ Even today I’m not sure what worked and what didn’t, what was me and 

what was simply life. How much influence did I really have over the 

personality of the former baby who cried only when we gave parties and who 

today, as a teenager, still dislikes socializing and crowds? When they were 

very small, I suppose I thought someday they would become who they were 

because of what I’d done. Now I suspect they simply grew into their true 
selves because they demanded in a thousand ways that I back off and let 

them be. . . . 9/ The books said to be relaxed and I was often tense, matter-of-fact, and I 

was sometimes over-the-top. And look how it all turned out. I wound up with 

the three people I like best in the world, who have done more than anyone 

to excavate my essential humanity. That’s what the books never told me. I 

was bound and determined to learn from the experts. It just took me a while 

to figure out who the experts were. Reprinted by permission of International Creative Management, Inc. Copyright © 2004.
